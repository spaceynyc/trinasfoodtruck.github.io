For image placeholders, you should add real images to the img directory. 

For now, you can use placeholder image services like:
- https://placehold.co/ 
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://picsum.photos/

Example usage in HTML:
<img src="https://placehold.co/400x300/2c6e91/white?text=Trina's+Food" alt="Placeholder Image">

Replace these with actual food truck and menu item photos for a real website.
